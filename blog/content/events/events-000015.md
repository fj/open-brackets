I'm presenting **Unikernels: Juggling Chainsaws** at [ContainerCamp SF 2016](https://container.camp/usa/2016). It will be a 20-minute recorded talk followed by Q&A.

### Abstract

Unikernels are a powerful new technique for generating compact, isolated containers with minimal surface area. But like all powerful tools, their benefits and disadvantages must be carefully weighed. Are unikernels worth the tradeoffs required?

In this talk, we'll try to answer this question by providing a brief introduction to unikernels, show you how to build your own, and explaining the most important considerations of running them in the real world.
