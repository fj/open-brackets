I'm presenting **Consensus in Cloud Foundry** at [Pivotal](http://pivotal.io/) on October 21st, 2015 in New York City, NY. It will be a 60-minute talk followed by Q&A.

### Abstract

Consensus isn't always easy to achieve among people, and certainly not for distributed systems like the architecture of Cloud Foundry. In this talk, we'll discuss how some kinds of distributed systems achieve consensus, how the [Diego](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release) scheduler in Cloud Foundry does it, and how this approach differs from alternative orchestration frameworks like [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) and [Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/).
