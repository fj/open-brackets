I'll be judging the [Hack.UVA](http://hackuva.io/) hackathon. It's a two-day event taking place on February 28th and open to all current [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu) students. If you're a student, you can register [here](http://goo.gl/IwhBJU)!


### Summary

In this talk, I'd like to discuss three points:

* the _right to repair_, an intellectual-property right which says if you own something, you should be allowed and able to repair it, and why that's a good thing

* how the increasing complexity of cars and heavy-handedness of manufacturers is making it harder for ordinary people to repair things they own

* how OBD-2, a diagnostic protocol originally intended to make it easier for people to diagnose what's happening with their cars, has effectively become a form of DRM in car software
